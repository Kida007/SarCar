#What All Have We Done

* We have implemented map on our android application
* We have written an algorithm which can predict whether collision is possible or not
* We have found out exact location of user using Google Fused Location Provider API.
* We have used Road API to find current road and nearby roads
* We just have to populate our database and use them with our algorithm to show it's practicality.
