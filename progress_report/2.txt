Updates for 10 AM

Our app is ready. Features:
1) We have successfully tested our algorithm and location, which is almost accurate because of the fused location API. We are planning to go on roads to test the algorithm.
2) We have created alerts for ambulance, that is whenever in traffic an ambulance is stuck, a broadcast will be sent to all nearby vehichles.
3) We have seggregated targetting for broadcast efficiently so that only those vehichles, who need the broadcast,receivethe broadcast.
4) We have implemented E-Challan, whenever someone drives faster than the speed limit, an echallan will be cut automatically after 5 violations.
